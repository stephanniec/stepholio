description: A Molecular Tool for Discovering Cardiac Hypertrophy Inhibitors
---
<center><h3>Overview</h3></center>
Cardiac hypertrophy refers to the enlargement and thickening of heart tissue in response to hemodynamic pressure and stress. It progresses pathologically when excessive tissue growth leads to abnormal mechanical stiffness, fibrosis, and cardiomyopathy. Current heart disease treatments are limited to expensive and sometimes invasive options. Eventually, patients either undergo pacemaker or heart transplant surgery, or are prescribed cocktails of biological inhibitors. To minimize the cost and risk of developing therapies, it would be useful to have an in vitro assay to screen for new drugs that inhibit cardiac hypertrophy. Unfortunately, no reliable high throughput assays exist.

For my senior capstone project, I created a set of mRNA biosensors that, when transfected into cells, fluorescently detects for mechanical and norepinephrine-induced stretch in cardiomyocytes. Specifically, I synthesized a molecular tool which accurately monitors miRNA expression levels in hypertrophic cells after 24 hours of applied stress.
