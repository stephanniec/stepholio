<center><h3>Overview</h3></center>
Subterranean robotic navigation and operation is important to a sundry of industries. Aside from mining, construction and reconnaissance, more and more autonomous robots are being deployed by the military to remotely locate and detonate explosive devices. Although there are numerous robots available for working beneath snow and hard earth, less options exist for exploring spaces beneath granular media. To address this disparity, the burrowing robot project was launched in an effort to develop new methods for allowing robots to "fly" within sand.

This prototype consists of 5 main components. Starting from the left to the right, an Archimedes screw mounted at the head of the robot will spin to part granular media and pull the robot forward. This is attached to an adapter plate which fits snugly around a DC motor shaft. A cylindrical cap on the motor itself prevents granules for falling into the exposed gear box. Wedged inside the protective cap are the wings which will prevent the entire body of the robot from rotating with the screw head. Lastly, an elongated hemisphere housing unit encloses the wire leads.

<b>TRIAL I</b><br>
`Objective:` Testing different permutations of wings with screw pitches<br>
`Testing ground:` Poppy seed bed<br>
`Goal:` To design and create a plane-like prototype which allows the robot to move consistently through the poppy seeds
