description: Exploring New Mechanisms for Moving Underground

<center><h3>Overview</h3></center>
Subterranean navigation and operation is important for a sundry of tasks, such as mining, construction, reconnaissance and bomb detection. Although there are numerous robots available for working in water and hard earth, fewer options exist for exploring granular media environments. The purpose of this project was to create an underground locomotor capable of following user-defined, arbitrary trajectories. This study was largely influenced by two papers: "Helical Locomotion in a Granular Medium" and "A Terradynamics of Legged Locomotion on Granular Media". <br>

Numerous iterations of a modular robot mounted with an auger were fabricated. Rapid, empirical tests within a loosely packed bed of poppy seeds were performed to clarify how certain auger parameters influenced the robot's motion. A theoretical model was derived to describe how the parameters of an auger and granular material characteristics affect the amount of propulsive force generated. A final prototype was built and tested to verify the model. Suggestions for design improvements were posed based on results obtained from these experiments.

A robot with 5 main components was designed. When powered, an Archimedes screw mounted at the head of the robot spun to part granular media and pull the robot forward. This was attached to an adapter plate which fit snugly around the shaft of a DC motor. A cylindrical cap on the motor itself stopped granules from falling into an exposed gear box. Wedged inside the protective cap were wings which prevented the body of the robot from rotating with the screw. Lastly, an elongated hemispherical housing unit covered the back of the robot to shield soldered wire junctions from wear and tear. Note, a modular robot was created to make testing different combinations of screws and wing shapes easier.

<b>Testing Ground</b><br>
A 60" x 21" x 4" bed of poppy seeds was used to characterize the behavior of the robot in granular substrates. Poppy seeds were chosen because the granules are roughly uniform in size.

<b>Experiments Performed</b><br>
For every prototype created, the following qualitative experiments were conducted: <br>
I. `Submerged swimming` - The robot starts inside the poppy seed bed with its wings parallel to the bottom of the tank <br>
II. `Surface swimming` - The robot starts on top of the poppy seed bed with its wings parallel to the bottom of the tank <br>
III. `Burrowing` - The robot starts at an angle with the nose of the auger pointed at the surface of the poppy seed bed

<b>Rapid Prototyping</b><br>
To improve the robot's design between trials, SolidWorks and the Ultimaker 3 3D printer were used to refine and manufacture PLA parts.
