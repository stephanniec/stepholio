<center><h3>Overview</h3></center>
Walk Off the Pages is a multimedia art project which honors two Studio Ghibli classics: Spirited Away (2001) and My Neighbor Totoro (1988). It is a personal endeavor which I started to keep my creativity alive and my love for hands-on building satisfied. The piece was modeled in SolidWorks, then fabricated using a CNC mill and a laser cutter.

The centerpiece is a 4" x 4" x 1.75" aluminum block which features the extruded silhouettes of Totoro and a small child dangling from a leaf. For a step-by-step description of how it was manufactured, please view the PDF linked below.

The display case is a 10" x 10" x 4" acrylic box with a cosmetic lid that highlights images from both films. It consists of 18 pieces that snugly slot together like a jigsaw puzzle. Scaffolding inside the box supports the weight of the centerpiece along 5 of its 6 faces. Balsa wood was used to verify if the smallest features could be cut. Acrylic with a thickness of 0.25" was used for the final product.
