<center><h3>Overview</h3></center>
Walk Off the Pages is a multimedia art project which honors two Studio Ghibli classics: Spirited Away (2001) and My Neighbor Totoro (1988). It is a personal endeavor which I started to keep my creative juices flowing and love for working with my hands alive. The piece was modeled in SolidWorks, then fabricated using a CNC mill and a laser cutter.  

<center><h3>The Aluminum Centerpiece</h3></center>

The centerpiece is a 4" x 4" x 1.75" aluminum block which features the extruded silhouettes of Totoro and a small child dangling from a leaf. For a step-by-step description of how it was manufactured, please view the PDF linked below.

<center><h3>The Acrylic Display Case</h3></center>

The display case is a 10" x 10" x 4" acrylic box with a decorative frame that highlights key images from both films. It contains a central compartment tailored to the dimensions of the aluminum block and internal scaffolding which supports the weight of the centerpiece along 5 of its 6 faces.

A slideshow of the container's CAD model and laser cut components will be coming soon!
