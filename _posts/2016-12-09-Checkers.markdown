<center><h3>Overview</h3></center>
Baxter Plays Checkers was created for the ME 495 robot part-manipulation competition at Northwestern. During the final exam, teams comprised of 4-6 students were asked to showcase a fun and original demonstration using a Baxter Research Robot to pick up and place objects.

Checkers is a ROS Python package which grants Baxter the ability to play the aforementioned game against a human opponent. The software features a 5 node network which helps Baxter autonomously recognize the state of the game, compute valid moves, and accurately transport red checkers pieces between squares using inverse kinematics and OpenCV. Below is a video of Baxter responding to a move.
