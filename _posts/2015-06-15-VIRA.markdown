<center><h3>Overview</h3></center>
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a strict drug regimen which combines multiple medications to impede HIV replication. When the treatment works, the concentration of HIV RNA in the bloodstream remains undetectable (at under 50 copies/mL). Routine viral load monitoring following the initiation of first-line ART is a recommended procedure which facilitates early detection of HIV drug resistance. It is also prohibitively expensive: a single genotyping assay can cost anywhere between $200-400, requires highly trained technicians and specialized laboratory equipment.<br>
<br>
While these price points are affordable in developed regions, such as the U.S and Western Europe, lifelong treatment is unsustainable for patients in limited-resource settings. To compensate, doctors have been known to track less demanding hematological and immunological <a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/12/12-102780/en/">parameters</a>, which oftentimes respond to the presence of drug resistance after a lengthy time delay. The lag period between ART failure and correct diagnosis is a critical problem which exposes the patient to further immune system degeneration and promotes the spread of mutant HIV strains.<br>
<br>
To confront these challenges, VIRA was created to provide physicians at Maputo Central Hospital with an open-source alternative for screening HIV patients for ART drug resistance.

<center><h3>The System</h3></center>
The VIRA diagnostic system is a semi-automated viral load monitoring device comprised of four key units: a low-cost centrifuge, an RNA extraction fluidic system, a PCR thermocycler, and a gel electrophoresis box. It is a versatile tool which allows minimally trained technicians to rapidly and accurately perform qualitative nucleic acid tests. To screen blood samples, VIRA runs the assay described below:<br>
<br>
1.<b> Separate</b> blood plasma from patient blood sample<br>
2.<b> Isolate</b> RNA from blood plasma<br>
3.<b> Generate</b> cDNA from extracted RNA via reverse transcription<br>
4.<b> Amplify</b> trace amounts of cDNA using PCR<br>
5.<b> Purify</b> PCR amplicons using clean up kits<br>
6.<b> Verify</b> if amplicons obtained belong to HIV in 1% agarose gel via gel electrophoresis<br>
<br>
The complete system costs approximately $500 ($7 per test), minimizes technician input, and is simple to troubleshoot.

<center><h3>The RNA Extraction Prototype</h3></center>

<center><b>Figure 1:</b> RNA Prototype Blueprint. Shelf 1 houses the user interface; shelf 2 holds the PCB; shelves 3 and 4 encase the pneumatic network; and shelf 5 positions the vacuum manifold underneath the reagent metering line.</center>
<br>
The RNA Extraction device is a fluidic system which semi-automates the process of isolating RNA from blood serum. It uses a network of Arduino-controlled pneumatic pumps to replicate precision pipetting, and features a hermetic vacuum manifold coupled with a solenoid valve to separate mixtures in place of a microcentrifuge. For testing purposes, prototype 1.0 was designed to be compatible with Roche’s High Pure Viral RNA Kit. Below is a slideshow of how the device has evolved over the years.

<center><h3>The Thermocyler</h3></center>

<center><b>Figure 2:</b> (L) The 2013 Thermocycler Prototype (R) The 2016 Thermocycler Prototype</center>
<br>
VIRA's thermocycler features a customized PCB which controls a Peltier chip that heats and cools an aluminum block. Temperature cycling is adjusted based on feedback from sensors embedded in the device. As samples loop through enzyme-specific temperature ranges, different sets of primers which target HIV's <i>env</i> gene are activated. We chose <i>env</i> because it codes for essential viral envelope proteins (gp120 and gp41) which HIV relies on to find and invade CD4 cells.

<center><b>Figure 3:</b> (L) Gel Box CAD Drawing (R) The Final Gel Box Prototype</center>
<br>
Although VIRA’s gel box mimics available electrophoresis devices, our product is unique in that the chassis comes disassembled in the form of a DIY kit. This distribution method was selected to reduce manufacturing costs, as well as provide interested members of the general public with an interactive opportunity to learn about extant medical devices and basic design techniques.

<center><h3>The Low-speed Centrifuge</h3></center>
<center><img src= "img/portfolio/1/centrifuge2.png" class="img-responsive" width="650">
<b>Figure 3:</b> The 2015 Centrifuge Prototype</center>
<br>
The low-speed centrifuge is an auxilary tool which can be used by technicians to perform both RNA extraction and reverse transcription. The prototype includes an ABS 3D printed plate head with an anti-shear design that interfaces with a simple motor. The alpha model, which now sits in Maputo Central Hospital, is capable of applying up to 8,000 x <i>g</i> and runs off of a self-sufficient power source. The latter feature was added to help clinics work through power outages, which regularly occur in Mozambique.

<br>
Engineering World Health (EWH) at UCSD is a burgeoning undergraduate organization dedicated to designing alternative, low-cost laboratory equipment for indigent populations. When I was a freshman, I was brought onboard the VIRA flagship design team as a member of the RNA extraction device group. From 2014 to 2015, I served as the RNA team lead. Prototype 1.0 was completed just before I graduated.
